2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ Publish installation.

   will be created inside the 'extension' directory.

   Linux users may use of the following commands depending on the file type:

   $ tar -zxvf ezpersonalfrontpage-extension-1.0.0.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezpersonalfrontpage-extension-1.0.0.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezpersonalfrontpage-extension-1.0.0.zip


4. Enable the extension in eZ Publish.

   To enable eZ Personal Frontpage, you have to edit the file
   'site.ini.append.php' located in the 'settings/override' directory.
   Add the following line under the [ExtensionSettings] section as first line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezpersonalfrontpage
   
   Make sure that ezpersonalfrontpage is above the eZ Webin extension (ezwebin).


5. Enable the design extension in eZ Publish.

   You also have to activate eZ Personal Frontpage as design extension.
   Therefore edit the 'site.ini.append.php' located
   in the 'settings/siteaccess/[your siteaccess]' directory
   and add 'ezpersonalfrontpage' under the [DesignSettings] section
   as AdditionalSiteDesign. Whereas [your siteaccess] is the siteaccess you plan
   to use for the personal frontpage. Usualy this is your language, e.g.  'ger'.
   For example the [DesignSettings] section could look as follows:

   [DesignSettings]
   SiteDesign=ezwebin
   AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=ezpersonalfrontpage
   AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=base


6. Add override rule for personal frontpage

   To override the personal frontpage template edit 'override.ini.append.php'
   located in the  'settings/siteaccess/[your siteaccess]' directory and
   add the following lines:

   [full_personal_frontpage]
   Source=node/view/full.tpl
   MatchFile=full/personal_frontpage.tpl
   Subdir=templates
   Match[class_identifier]=personal_frontpage
   
   In the majority of cases you have to edit 'settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site/
   override.ini.append.php' instead of 'settings/siteaccess/[your language]/
   override.ini.append.php'.

   Log in to your eZ Publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   select 'Packages' and then click the 'Import Package' button.

   and click to 'import package'.

   '/extension/ezwebin/settings/' and add the following line to the
   WebsiteToolbarSettings block:

   AvailableForClasses[]=personal_frontpage

   Log in to your eZ Publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   and then click the 'Clear all caches' button.

   and/or 'var/[your_siteaccess]/cache/' directory.

    Browsers usually cache visited pages in a folder somewhere. The next time
    the same pages are visited, they are loaded faster because some of the
    information already exists on the local storage device.
